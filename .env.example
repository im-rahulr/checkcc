# Environment Variables for Netlify Deployment
# Copy this file to .env.local for local development
# Set these variables in your Netlify dashboard under Site Settings > Environment Variables

# Currently, this application uses Supabase for data storage
# Supabase credentials are configured in src/integrations/supabase/client.ts
# The public/anon key is safe to include in the frontend bundle

# If you need to add environment-specific variables, prefix them with VITE_
# Example:
# VITE_API_URL=https://your-api.com
# VITE_FEATURE_FLAG=true

# Build Configuration (handled by Netlify)
NODE_ENV=production
